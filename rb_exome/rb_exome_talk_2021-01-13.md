## Before Talk
1. how to manage STR? currently have STR from submitted cell lines; need to get STR again after thawing?

1. look at icell8 from triche lab -- cell sorter not FACS. Also ask Shahab
2. Naishi at 10x; 
3. Time to use Shahab to get neuroblastoma from elsewhere
4. should have more meetings with Hicks; need 
5. 


miller 

2nd antibiotic

1. original bfp-dcas9-KRAB
a. plasmid or glycerol stock? 
2. puromycin control sequence for gRNAs pcdh-lenti-u6-gRNA-puromycin
3. hygromycin control sequence for gRNAs pcdh-lenti-u6-gRNA-hygromycin

virus already available and MH gave DNA with 

need to get into RB41 and RB49 need to set up resistance marker 

BFP to sort for dcas9 and resistance to test gRNA; need to have BFP tagged with antibiotic resistance; 

DC: DS should take out samples; Jay keep track of constructs; 

protocl for transfection
1. jay already has midiprep for packaging plasmids
2. jay has not concentrated;
