1. comment at start of discussion: "For Discussion: includes sequence changes, not copy number; inclusion of copy number likely gives more examples but resolution not sufficient (we detected two BCOR changes of xx bp; 
except in one study. could likely increase power to detect." (p19)
targetted sequencing will miss most retinoblastoma-related recurrent changes, in specific genes and pathways. 

veracity of variants:  Zhang and McEvoy confirmed all by Sanger. We confirmed some; Kooi did not and may have some spurious."

2. plot AA changes in NAF1 (p21)?
more relevant if we find COSMIC; can plot those 

3. refs to Manning (

4. mskcc poly paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30150773/

4. can explain waterfall (p25)
share SCNA for all studies; check if Kooi describes relative SNV/SCNA burden

5. ref to qi 2014 (p26)

actually qi 2017

6. talk about notes? (p28)

1. are any recurrent SNVs in any SCNAs make table 

low
1. should cultuer T-29
2. dropped CORO6
3. how would a permutation test work for recurrence?

come back to this

4. add KEGG?

5. look at GEO for only non-protein-altering changes

look up
