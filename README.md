# notes
the genome wide impact of trisomy 21 on DNA methylation and its implications for hematopoiesis

avoid editorializing about your audience "might be bored by this"

cd4 and nRBC split on heatmap

is DMR run by gene or arbitrarily? where regions: comb-p and DMRcate

ask Long about bioanalyzer

paper about transduction into Rb cells 

check DQ paper about puro selection

PAN2 needs to be snGTO? 

check BCOR transcriptomic effect is the same in vivo and in vitro 

BCOR in vitro and in vivo 

put BCOr into lines where deleted 

PAN2 effect might be visible as a increaase in RNA biogenesis (Kooi)

skillset bioinfo and xenograpft connets with discovery of PAN2 by me 

need to nail down deep contrast with side stamp-collecting approach 

snRNAseq capable 
bases on my work; have skillset; and allows to go deep 

how distinguish between specialized late cone population and a specialized cone population? 

why would there be two different paths to cones? 

Subclonal heterogeneity

Have paper under review 

Bioinfo strength 

Training fellowship
Career plan is imp.

People guiding 

Jim Hicks

David Craig

Push the subtleties of GTO 

Can do PAN2 in the next few weeks enrichment pcr 

Start with tumors with tractable subclonal heterogeneity 


Can find a mentor for tail length issues? 

Goal to deconvo. Contributions of SNVS and SCNAs in retinoblastoma tumor progression. 

When het for SCNA find effect when het for SNV find effect. How do they relate? 

Requires:
New methods
Appropriate samples 
Domain expertise 

Have tools? Have impact? 

Priority would be pan2 qpcr 

t

Push lab experience with MYCN 



PAN2 knockdown and overexpression in cel lines 
Detect MYCN effects 
Detect biogenesis signature
Detect tail length changes

PAN2 kD or oe then mycn persist? 

could generate pan2 mutant in fetal retina as positive control 

mycna rb have 100x higher mycn than cones 

vectors that express mycn make similarly high mycn in cones 

can discern increase MYCN with disruption of deadenylation?

can atrribute to MYCN increased expression of other transcript changes

copy increased level of MYCN w/ PAN2 mutation 

can measuer how long-lived rnas are? like velocity 

up by 10x mycn (vector) or 2-3x mycn in pan2 mutant 


TODO

check with PIBBS about requirements for thesis comittee (chair?) 
check with Ite? 

PAN2 genotyping or (taqman)?
order primer pairs
ask liya about partial target enrichment (PAN2) aliquot - pcr - sequence or include primers in final GTO amp steps? 

follup with Rish 
underrep of short in GTO, how bad is it? 
worth it to titrate fragmentation buffer? 

GTO; what samples are worthwhile?
found subclonal het in tumors for RB41 
reassess tumor samples 

how many new samples are viably frozen and what are profiles?
