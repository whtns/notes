casues and repair of DNA double-strand repair 

steps for NHEJ

tool belt: Ku 70/80

Polymerage: mu or lamda

Nuclease: artemis/KNA-PKcs 

member of metallo-B-lactamase domain 

Kinase/Phosphatase: PNK

Ligase complex

Artemis:
1. has different activity in different DNA toplogies
a. blut, 3' overhang, 5' overhang, hairpin
hairpin substrates arise during VDJ recomb. 

gel assay: 
radio label one end of DNA substrate

quesition: how is NHEJ effieicinty measured in gel? 

spend longer time on aims so others can take them in

specific aims:
1. mech understand of NHEJ core factor

2. 5' phosophsate on antiparallel strand afect rate of NHEJ

test cc3 on 5' strand?

aim3: evaluate DNA ligation in context of chromatin

ku access flanking DNA


focus on monoculeosome first 

epimark nucleosome assembly kit from NEB

nucleosome NHEJ assay 

future directions 
1. 

NHEJ sensitive to sequence?
