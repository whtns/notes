# notes
the genome wide impact of trisomy 21 on DNA methylation and its implications for hematopoiesis

avoid editorializing about your audience "might be bored by this"

cd4 and nRBC split on heatmap

is DMR run by gene or arbitrarily? where regions: comb-p and DMRcate

ask Long about bioanalyzer

paper about transduction into Rb cells 

check DQ paper about puro selection

PAN2 needs to be snGTO? 

check BCOR transcriptomic effect is the same in vivo and in vitro 

BCOR in vitro and in vivo 

put BCOr into lines where deleted 

PAN2 effect might be visible as a increaase in RNA biogenesis (Kooi)

skillset bioinfo and xenograpft connets with discovery of PAN2 by me 

need to nail down deep contrast with side stamp-collecting approach 

snRNAseq capable 
bases on my work; have skillset; and allows to go deep
