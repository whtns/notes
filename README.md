markers
1. difficult to find nuclear markers while retaining nuclear integrity (for RNA retention)
2. ask annie about distinguishing nuclei by size/shape; FACS machine that takes pictures of cells?

TODO: run CRX with Weri 



modifications to nextera
1. ssv4 lysis buffer: 2.5x or 5x
2. cDNA amplification cycles: 15, 17, 20
3. fragmentation buffer: w/ or w/o
4. transposase conc.: DNA conc. should be between 0.1-0.3 ng/ul. 
5. nextera amplification cycles: 12+; profile of bioanalyzer may look different

smallest amount yet tried by SHL 0.03 ng/ul. likely nucleic concentration is ~0.01 ng/ul (6 pg DNA + 6 pg RNA)

5. check protocols for Tn5 concentration of nextera

?helpful to add proteinase k before gdna amplification?
