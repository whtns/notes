1. Intro
a. ALL most common childhood worldwide ~20% of childhood cancer
b. ethnic disparities in ALL
c. LATINo 1.3 times white, 2x black; low survival after therapy
d. genetic risk loci account for 31% of familial risk 
e. most GWAS limited to europeans
2. Goal trans-ethnic meta-analysis
a. data prep
b. ethnic spec 
c. multi ethnic
d. follow-up
3. data prep
a. california cancer records linkage project (CCRLP)
b. Kaiser Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging 
4. QC
a. identity-by-descent 
genome het rate 
pop outliers 
5. datasets replication
a. COG and WTCCC (no available self-identified ethnic
b. admixture is software for ancestry inference 
c. CCLS had self-id white and latino 
6. data prep
a. imputation-what is external reference haplotype data?
6. ethnic-spec GWAS
a. genotype probability using 20 PCS in logistic regresssion
b. AA ~ 124/2067
c. EA ~ 318/8410
d. white 1162/57341
7. trans-ethnic meta analysis
a. inverse variance weighted method
b. QQ plot with lambda stat shows any bias (geno artifact; pop strat)
8. Results
a. 12 loci had significance (3/9) novel/known
b. 16 reported SNPS were replicated 
c. conditional analysis with p-value < 5e-8 after conditioning on top snp
8. novel snps
a. 6q23- rep in COG but not CCLS; may affect enhancer of MYB (rs9376090)
b. 10q21 (rs9415680) - 130 highly correlated SNPs; may affect JMJD1C  and affect Pax5 and PTCF
c. 10q21 (rs10998283) - intron of TET1 
9 follow-up (secondary studies
a. replication
b. PRS
c. Heritability
d. PESCA
10. PRS
a. sum of individual genotype x weighted by effect size B at m SNPs
b. calculated on discovery and replication cohorts with known and known+novel Snps
c. dist of PRS novel between latino and white 
11. heritability 
a. familial risk per variant (FRR)
c. bivariate GREML
d. genome-wide complex trait analysis
e. PESCA- population specific/shared causal alleles 

what is winner's curse?


what is gold-standard reference for known snps?
* need more plots! for sample numbers in dataset replications slides
