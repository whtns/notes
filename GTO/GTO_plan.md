# TO DO 2020-09-17

1. prep solutions
  a. aliquot ez lysis buffer (nuclear isolation)
  b. Nuclei wash and resuspension buffer (prepare chilled, 4°C) 
    1x PBS 
    1.0% BSA
    0.2 U/μl RNase Inhibitor

1. Section tumors CHLA-VC-RB-002, CHLA-VC-RB-005, CHLA-VC-RB-068, CHLA-VC-RB-071 and place in low-retention 0.5 ml tubes at -20 deg. 

one tumor section at a time:

2. abbreviated 'frankenstein protocol'


DC: if dnaseq works well can understand variability in clonal populations 

need to get protocol for DNAseq -- just use Seqxe 

how do nuclei get dispersed in lysis buffer; useful to find out via microscope 

need to locate low-retention tips, etc. for sorting 

lysis buffer optimized 

can capture DNAseq with side population from sorting 


1. can enrich rb tumor cells with surface marker? (Slyper et al., 2020) used anti-CD45+ MACS microbeads

2. secondary staining [qc](https://twitter.com/LGMartelotto/status/1234274242197278721?s=20)
talk to sijia about pre-conjugated rb; could also stain for MYCN--need to get pre-conjugated antibody 

not an issue to permeabilize for rb staining; maybe got in a different color?

need to titrate how small amount can do; need to id sample w/ low tumor fraction
