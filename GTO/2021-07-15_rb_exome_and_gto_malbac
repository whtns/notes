## talk with Claire and DC about RB exome noncoding variants

3' UTR modeled with transfection
1. RNA binding proteins
2. splicing

check DYNC1H1 with NCBI "gene"

can we obtain luciferase constructs from Jay?
need to check base-editing with Beehive/CRISPOR
editing enzymes have different PAMS

plan for CRISPR base editing
1. feasible?
2. create gRNA and vectors
3. which cells? weri and RB31
4. how will we introduce into cells? nucleofection

expose cells to puromycin for 1 day should select sufficiently
Jennifer has luciferase reporter assays 

## talk with Liya re MALBAC
1. can we use an alternative primer for smart-seq
2. need to get Bst polymerase for linear stage of MALBAC
3. Liya provided box

We should be concerned about:
1. protease
2. spin-down
3. use axygen maximum recovery tips

We may need to use existing MALBAC datasets to normalize SCNA results

can assume 1x10^6 reads of gDNA
should use PE 150 reads

use NEBNEXT ultra II fs kit for indexing 

will need to use 50% less protease to compensate for loss due to fragmentation

protocol is designed for ug level of DNA

What effect might smart-seq superimposed on MALBAC PCR have?

check with Sunhye that smart-seq primers are identical at the 3' and 5' end
