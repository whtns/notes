pt1 (differentiation) and pt2 (proliferation)

1. how are genes filtered?
2. find correlation b/w eigengene and pseudotime or cluster id
3. sort me heatmap rows by pseudotime and by cluster id

4. email liya about sequencing schedule
5. need to do H&E on all? rb tumors

6. ask HS about ARR3, RXRG, or SYK for sorting nuclei
7. try nuclear staining of block with high purity; 


TODO: create analysis of read discard on GTO segmentation analysis

why are some SCNA no good, while cDNA libraries are all good?

scale volumes to 5ul 

check with SHL about cold block for fragmentation buffer
