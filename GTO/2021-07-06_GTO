1.	GTO 

a.	ask Long about bioanalyzer
b.	PAN2 needs to be snGTO? 

2.	CRISPRi
a.	paper about transduction into Rb cells 
b.	check DQ paper about puro selection
3.	PAN2/BCOR
a.	check BCOR transcriptomic effect is the same in vivo and in vitro 
b.	put BCOR into lines where deleted 
c.	PAN2 effect might be visible as an increase in RNA biogenesis (Kooi)
d.	Can do PAN2 in the next few weeks enrichment pcr 

4.	F31 writing
a.	Goal to deconvo. Contributions of SNVS and SCNAs in retinoblastoma tumor progression. 
b.	I have a skill set bioinfo and xenograpft connets with discovery of PAN2 by me 
c.	need to nail down deep contrast with side stamp-collecting approach 
d.	snRNAseq capable 
e.	bases on my work; have skillset; and allows to go deep 
f.	Subclonal heterogeneity
g.	Have paper under review 
h.	Bioinfo strength 
i.	Training fellowship
j.	Career plan is imp.
k.	People guiding 
i.	Jim Hicks
ii.	David Craig
l.	Push the subtleties of GTO 
m.	Start with tumors with tractable subclonal heterogeneity 
n.	Can find a mentor for tail length issues? 
o.	When het for SCNA find effect when het for SNV find effect. How do they relate? 
p.	Requires:
i.	New methods
ii.	Appropriate samples 
iii.	Domain expertise 
iv.	Have tools? Have impact? 
q.	Priority would be pan2 qpcr
r.	Push lab experience with MYCN 
s.	PAN2 knockdown and overexpression in cel lines 
t.	Detect MYCN effects 
u.	Detect biogenesis signature
v.	Detect tail length changes
w.	PAN2 kD or oe then mycn persist? 
x.	could generate pan2 mutant in fetal retina as positive control 
y.	mycna rb have 100x higher mycn than cones 
z.	vectors that express mycn make similarly high mycn in cones 
aa.	can discern increase MYCN with disruption of deadenylation?
bb.	can atrribute to MYCN increased expression of other transcript changes
cc.	copy increased level of MYCN w/ PAN2 mutation 
dd.	can measure how long-lived rnas are? like velocity 
ee.	up by 10x mycn (vector) or 2-3x mycn in pan2 mutant 
5.	TODO
a.	check with PIBBS about requirements for thesis comittee (chair?) 
b.	check with Ite? 
c.	PAN2 genotyping or (taqman)?
d.	order primer pairs
e.	ask liya about partial target enrichment (PAN2) aliquot - pcr - sequence or include primers in final GTO amp steps? 
f.	follup with Rish 
g.	underrep of short in GTO, how bad is it? 
h.	worth it to titrate fragmentation buffer? 
i.	GTO; what samples are worthwhile?
j.	found subclonal het in tumors for RB41 
k.	reassess tumor samples 
l.	how many new samples are viably frozen and what are profiles? 
i.	ineligible: 11 + 17
ii.	eligible: 17 
iii.	unknown: 2
