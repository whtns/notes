high
1. comment at start of discussion: "For Discussion: includes sequence changes, not copy number; inclusion of copy number likely gives more examples but resolution not sufficient (we detected two BCOR changes of xx bp; 
except in one study. could likely increase power to detect." (p19)
2. plot AA changes in SAMD9 (p21)?
3. refs to Manning (


targetted sequencing will miss most retinoblastoma-related recurrent changes, in specific genes and pathways. 

veracity of variants:  Zhang and McEvoy confirmed all by Sanger. We confirmed some; Kooi did not and may have some spurious."

low
1. should cultuer T-29
2. dropped CORO6
3. how would a permutation test work for recurrence?
4. add KEGG?
5. look at GEO for only non-protein-altering changes
