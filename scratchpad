repurposing cardiac glycosides as potential cancer therapeutics

induced by glucose starvation 

50% homology to hsp70; exclusive to ER

role of grp78 in unfolded protein response 



XBP1 driven splicing affected by 78-unbound IRE1

regulate hallmarks of cancer 

1. cell death 

immunity and inflammation

upregulated in aggressive cancer 

other GRPs also involved to lesser extents 



ran compound-screening project to find grp78 inhib


compound library 

NIH clinical collection is a common library 

cardiac glycosides are common in the screen 

1. bind and inhib NA/K ATPase pump

have common structure 

digoxin most famous; used to treat heart failure. 

how digoxin works: 
digoxin inhibits pump > conc of Na rise > CA 3exchange worse > CA rise > SERCA pump in ER works worse > muscle contraction is stronger 



digoxin enhancs overall survival of cancer patients (menger et  al. 2012)

oleandrin as another cardiac glycoside > nerium oleander


three aims 

1. cg suppress ER stress-induced GRP78 

induced ER stress with LanC then treat with Tg, Tu, 2-DG

2. mech that cg suppress grp78

3. anticancer effects in vitro in vivo

oleandrin blocks ER-stress induction of GRP78 in MCF-7 GFP/Luc cells 


aim 1 
effect of suppress grrr 

p-EIF2a is marker for URP


MTT assay for cell viability of

questions 
1. don't understand mechanism of titration; is there production of GRP-78 in the model? how are western blots good evidence?

aim 2
determine mechainsm that CG suppress GRP{78 expression 

all subunits transcribed separately?

NA/K ATPase have a, b and FXPY

different cell lines have different levels of a subunits 
a3 more responsive to CG treatment 

xenograft mouse with oleandrin survive better; grp78 reduced in treated oleandrin




future directions
1. test effect of CGs on tumor xenograft in mice

2. test effets of DGs on colon organoids

3. mechani that DG supress ER-stress induced GRP78 expression
