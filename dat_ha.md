Dat Ha presented on his project: 

Repurposing cardiac glycosides as potential cancer therapeutics

He began with an overview of his lab's protein of interest, GRP78/BiP. GRP78 is an ER charperione analogous to hsp70 which acts as a part of the unfolded protein response. Unlike other partners in the unfolded protein response, GRP78 is exclusive to the endoplasmic reticulum. Where it acts to facilitate protein folding, to degrade misfolded proteins, and to prevent protein aggregation. It is a regulator of ER stress signaling. 

Dat laid out the factors that induce ER stress in cancer both intrinsic to cancer cells--mutation, metabolism, and proliferation, and extrinsic--nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and low pH. 

He descibed the other factors in the unfolded protein response that are affected by GRP78 level. Including post-translational processing by ATF6 in the golgi, phosphorylation and signaling cascades driven by PERK, and splicing of the transcription factor XBP1. All of these effects lead to proliferation during cancer. 

Dat described how GRP78 upregulation affects  many hallmarks of cancer including cell death and immunity and inflammation. GRP78 upregulation is widespread across many cancers and is upregulated in aggressive cancer though other GRPs are also involved to lesser extents. 

To investigate therapeutic targets for GRP78 inhibition, his lab ran a compound-screening project. This screen included the NIH clinical collection compound library. The screen yieled a large number of cardiac glycosides including digoxin and oleandrin. Cardiac glycosides are commonly used to treat heart conditions by 
binding and inhibiting the NA+/K+ ATPase pump. Dat presented data showing improved overall survival of cancer patients treated with digoxin (menger et  al. 2012). 

He is studying a similar compound, oleandrin. With three aims: 
1. Determine whether cardiac glycosides suppress ER stress-induced GRP78 
2. Identify the mechanism by which cardiac glycosides suppress grp78
3. Measure the effect of cardiac glycosides on cancer cell growth in vitro in vivo

aim 1
Dat carried out a series of western blot analyses in which he induced ER stress with LanC in cancer cell liens, then treated with several cardiac glycosides, including Tg, Tu, and 2-DG
These showed a reduction in GRP78 following induction of p-EIF2a--amarker for the unfolded protein response. He also conducted an MTT assay for cell viability of after treatmend with cardiac glycosides

aim 2
Dat aims to determine the mechains by which cardiac glycosides suppress GRP78 expression. Dat showed that cancers in general and several of his cancer cell lines have differential expression of subunit isoforms of the Na/K ATPase pump. It appears that high expression of the a3 subunit is a good predictor of response to cardiac glycoside treatment. 

aim 3
Dat showed that oleandrin blocks ER-stress induction of GRP78 in MCF-7 GFP/Luc cells and cited a study showing that a xenograft mouse treated with oleandrin had improved survival 

Dat outlined several future directions including 
1. his own study of the effect of cardiac glycosides on tumor xenograft in mice
2. An examination of of cardiac glycosides on colon organoids
3. A goal to identify the mechanism by which cardiac glycosides supress ER-stress induced GRP78 expression 

A question for Dat, maybe owing to my ignorance of protein stoichiometry in the cell.  
1. How is grp78 'titrated' away in response to stress/level of unfolded protein? Does that result in increased production of GRP78? How quickly? Are western blots therefore, good assays to detect changes in grp78? Is there a way to track turnover, rather than simply abundance of grp78 following treatment with cardiac glycosides?
